# Embed Iframe
Files to place on customers page with iframe pointed to their Returns page. It listens to the React app for document size changes and hides or unhides the store's Shopify header when going through the exchange v2 process.

### How it works
The parent window contains this JS code for listening to postMessages {object} send from within a child iframe.
1. First default iframe height set and stored by the parent.
2. Parent listens for a height param from child and changes height of its iframe.
3. Parent listens for a resetStyle param from child and will reset iframe height to the stored height (this is used when pages have changed i.e. Home > Success)
4. Parent listens for a hideShopifyHeader param from child and will hide the Shopify header.
5. Parent listens for a showShopifyHeader param from child and will unhide the Shopify header.

### Sample Shopify Template Usage
```liquid
{% assign shop_url = 'https://360.postco.co/<shop_name>' %}

<iframe id="postco360-iframe" src="{{shop_url}}?embed=true" width="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
{{ page.content }}

### How to push a new version to jsdelivr
- Make change(s) to any `.js` files and push to the `main` branch.
- The GitHub Action will automatically:
  - Minify all JavaScript files using Terser
  - Commit the minified files back to the repository
  - Create a new release with an incremented version tag (e.g., `v1.0.4` â†’ `v1.0.5`)
  - Make the new version available on jsDelivr CDN
